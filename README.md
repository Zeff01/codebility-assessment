As a beginner in frontend development, I’ve learned so much through this assessment. At first glance, I thought it would be difficult since I don’t have a strong background in design—my expertise leans more toward data analysis. However, this challenge gave me the opportunity to explore and apply key frontend concepts.

Through this assessment, I gained practical experience using TypeScript and React, especially in structuring components and managing props to write cleaner, more maintainable code. I also explored Tailwind CSS, which helped me understand responsive design, even though I initially lacked confidence in building UI layouts.

With the help of AI tools to reinforce the fundamentals, I was able to overcome my initial uncertainty and grow more comfortable working with these technologies. I also learned the importance of organizing code and began improving aspects like naming conventions and component structure.

Thank you, Codeability, for this opportunity. I know I have a long journey ahead to become a better frontend developer, but this experience has become a solid stepping stone. It has sparked a genuine eagerness in me to keep learning and to deepen my understanding of website structure and user interfaces.

I'm truly excited to continue developing my skills in this field.
