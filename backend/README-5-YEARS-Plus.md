# Backend Assessment (5+ Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Senior** backend assessment! Your task is to design a small API that demonstrates your architecture skills and knowledge of backend patterns. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a small API with clean architecture
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Integrate with an external service
4. Demonstrate error handling and logging

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/backend
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/5-years-plus-backend
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Implementation

1. Create an API with these core features:

   - User authentication (JWT or similar)
   - Role-based access control (admin/user roles)
   - Integration with an external API (weather, finance, etc.)
   - Proper error handling and logging

2. Focus on these architectural aspects:

   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Service/repository pattern
   - Middleware for authentication/authorization
   - Centralized error handling

3. Include a simple README explaining:
   - Your architecture decisions
   - How to run the application
   - Any shortcuts taken due to time constraints

### 5. Test Your Work

1. Test your API using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or curl
2. Ensure authentication, authorization, and API integration work properly

### 6. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement API with clean architecture"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/5-years-plus-backend
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Include details about your architecture and implementation decisions

## What We're Looking For

- Clean architecture and code organization
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Error handling and logging
- External service integration
- Code quality and maintainability

## Technology Choices

- Use Node.js
- Choose any framework you're comfortable with
- Use JavaScript or TypeScript (preferably TypeScript)
- Select any libraries that fit your architecture
- Choose any database approach (or mock it if time is limited)

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

Focus on demonstrating your architectural thinking rather than implementing many features. Quality over quantity is key.

**Good luck!**
