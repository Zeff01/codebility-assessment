# Mobile Assessment (1-2 Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **1-2 Years** mobile development assessment! Your task is to implement a simple UI screen based on a design mockup. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a single screen based on the provided design mockup
2. Implement basic styling and layout
3. Add simple button interaction

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/mobile
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/1-2-years-mobile
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Implementation

1. Look at the design mockup in the `image-test` folder
2. Create a screen that matches this design:

   - Implement the layout structure
   - Match colors and typography
   - Create buttons with press states

3. Keep it simple:
   - Focus on visual accuracy
   - Make sure buttons respond to touches
   - Ensure the screen looks good on different device sizes

### 5. Test Your Work

1. Run the application using Expo:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Test on iOS/Android simulator or your physical device
3. Check that the layout matches the design mockup

### 6. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement UI screen based on design mockup"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/1-2-years-mobile
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Include a screenshot of your implementation
   - Add a brief description of your approach

## What We're Looking For

- Visual accuracy compared to the mockup
- Clean, readable code
- Proper use of React Native components
- Basic responsiveness

## Technology Choices

- Use the existing Expo setup
- Feel free to use StyleSheet or any styling approach you prefer
- Choose any additional libraries if needed

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

This assessment is intentionally simple. We're looking for clean code and attention to visual details rather than complex functionality.

**Good luck!**
