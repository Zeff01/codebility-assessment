# Mobile Assessment (5+ Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Senior** mobile development assessment! Your task is to create a small food app feature that demonstrates your architecture decisions and React Native knowledge. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a restaurant details screen with menu items
2. Implement a cart feature for adding items
3. Focus on architecture and component design
4. Use mock data (no API integration required)

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/mobile
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/5-years-plus-mobile
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Implementation

1. Create a restaurant details screen that:

   - Shows restaurant information (name, cuisine type, rating)
   - Displays a list of menu items with prices
   - Allows adding items to a cart
   - Updates a cart icon/count when items are added

2. Focus on these architectural aspects:

   - Clean component structure
   - State management approach
   - Separation of concerns
   - Code organization

3. Include mock data directly in your code (no need for API calls)

### 5. Test Your Work

1. Run the application using Expo:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Test on iOS/Android simulator or your physical device
3. Verify that the restaurant details and cart functionality work properly

### 6. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement restaurant details with cart functionality"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/5-years-plus-mobile
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Include screenshots of your implementation
   - Add a brief explanation of your architecture decisions

## What We're Looking For

- Clean architecture and code organization
- Proper component design and separation of concerns
- Effective state management approach
- Attention to UX details
- Code quality and maintainability

## Technology Choices

- Use the existing Expo setup
- Choose any state management approach
- Select any UI components or styling libraries
- Use any navigation solution you prefer

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

Focus on demonstrating your architectural thinking rather than implementing many features. Quality over quantity is key.

**Good luck!**
