# Frontend Assessment (5+ Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **Senior** frontend assessment! Your task is to create a small dashboard that demonstrates your architecture decisions and React knowledge. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a small dashboard with two main components:
   - Weather widget using a weather API
   - Financial widget showing stock or cryptocurrency data
2. Focus on architecture and component design
3. Implement proper data fetching and error handling

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/frontend
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/5-years-plus
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Implementation

1. Create a dashboard with:

   - A weather widget using any weather API
   - A financial widget using any stock/crypto API
   - A clean, simple layout

2. Focus on these technical aspects:

   - Clean component architecture
   - Proper data fetching with loading/error states
   - Basic caching or state management
   - Simple responsive design

3. Data Sources (suggestions):
   - Weather: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) or any similar API
   - Financial: [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/) or any similar API
   - Feel free to use mock data if API access is problematic

### 5. Test Your Work

1. Make sure your application works on different screen sizes
2. Check that your error handling works properly

### 6. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement dashboard with weather and financial widgets"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/5-years-plus
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Include a brief explanation of your architecture decisions

## What We're Looking For

- Clean architecture and code organization
- Proper component design and separation of concerns
- Effective data fetching and state management
- Error and edge case handling
- Clean, maintainable code

## Technology Choices

- Use Next.js or React
- Choose any libraries or tools you're comfortable with
- Feel free to use any styling approach
- Select any state management solution that fits the task

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

Focus on quality over quantity. We're more interested in seeing your architectural approach and code quality than a large number of features.

**Good luck!**
