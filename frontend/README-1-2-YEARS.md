# Frontend Assessment (1–2 Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **1–2 Years** frontend assessment! Your task is to implement a simple landing page based on the design of [Moola.com](https://www.moola.com/). This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Implement a landing page similar to [Moola.com](https://www.moola.com/)
2. Focus on the hero section and one additional section of your choice
3. Make it responsive for desktop and mobile
4. Use Next.js (or React if you prefer)

## What We're Looking For

- Clean, readable code
- Basic responsive design
- Attention to visual details
- Simple component structure

## Time Allowance

This assessment is intentionally simple and focused. We're looking for quality over quantity, so don't feel pressured to implement every section of the website.

**Good luck!**
