# Frontend Assessment (3–5 Years Experience)

## Overview

Welcome to the **3–5 Years** frontend assessment! Your task is to build a simple product listing page with data fetching. This assessment is designed to take **1-2 hours** of coding time, but you have **1-2 days** to complete it.

## Task Summary

1. Create a page that fetches and displays products from a public API
2. Implement a simple detail view when a product is clicked
3. Add basic filtering or search functionality
4. Make it responsive

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment](https://github.com/Zeff01/codebility-assessment)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/codebility-assessment.git
cd codebility-assessment/frontend
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b firstname-lastname/3-5-years-frontend
```

Replace `firstname-lastname` with your actual name.

### 4. Implementation

1. Create a product listing page that:

   - Fetches data from any public API (suggestion: [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/))
   - Displays products in a grid or list
   - Shows basic product information (image, name, price)

2. Add a simple detail view:

   - When a product is clicked, show more details
   - This can be a new page or a modal

3. Implement basic functionality:
   - Add simple filtering or search functionality
   - Handle loading and error states

### 5. Test Your Work

1. Make sure your application works on different screen sizes
2. Check that your data fetching and interactions work properly

### 6. Submit Your Work

1. Commit and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement product listing page"
   git push origin firstname-lastname/3-5-years-frontend
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "Contribute" and "Open pull request"
   - Make sure the base repository is set to `Zeff01/codebility-assessment`
   - Add a title and brief description of your implementation

## What We're Looking For

- Clean, readable code
- Proper data fetching approach
- Basic state management
- Responsive design
- Error handling

## Technology Choices

- You can use Next.js or React
- Feel free to use any styling approach (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
- Choose any state management solution you're comfortable with

## Time Allowance

- **Expected coding time**: 1-2 hours
- **Submission deadline**: 1-2 days

Focus on quality over quantity. A clean, simple implementation is better than a complex one with bugs.

**Good luck!**
